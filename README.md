# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project is a Deep Learning-based Face Mask Detection system utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of people as either "with mask" (1) or "without mask" (0). The model is trained on a large dataset of facial images to achieve high accuracy in real-time or static image environments.
