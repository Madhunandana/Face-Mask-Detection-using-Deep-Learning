# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project is a Deep Learning-based Face Mask Detection system utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of people as either "with mask" (1) or "without mask" (0). The model is trained on a large dataset of facial images to achieve high accuracy in real-time or static image environments.


Face Mask Detection using CNNA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project developed to detect whether a person in an image is wearing a protective face mask or not.FeaturesBinary Classification: Distinguishes between two classes: "with mask" and "without mask".Custom CNN Architecture: Built using TensorFlow/Keras with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers, incorporating Dropout for regularization.Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing images to a uniform 128x128 pixel resolution and feature scaling (normalization).High Performance: Achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 92.56% on the testing dataset.DatasetThe model was trained and validated using the Face Mask Dataset sourced from Kaggle.Source: omkargurav/face-mask-datasetTotal Images: 7,553 images.Distribution:With Mask: 3,725 images (labeled as 1)Without Mask: 3,828 images (labeled as 0)Model ArchitectureThe CNN model uses the following sequential architecture:LayerTypeOutput Shape / Description1Conv2D32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation2MaxPooling2DPool size 2x23Conv2D64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation4MaxPooling2DPool size 2x25FlattenFlattens the 2D feature maps6Dense128 units, ReLU activation7Dropout0.5 rate8Dense64 units, ReLU activation9Dropout0.5 rate10Dense2 units, Sigmoid activation (Output Layer)The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function. It was trained for 25 epochs.Technologies and DependenciesThe project is built using Python and the following key libraries:tensorflow / keras: Core framework for building and training the CNN model.numpy: For numerical operations and efficient handling of image arrays.opencv (cv2): Used for image processing tasks.matplotlib: For visualizing images and training history.sklearn: Used for splitting the data into training and testing sets (train_test_split).How to RunClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
cd YourRepoName
Install Dependencies:Bashpip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn
Download the Dataset:Required: You will need a Kaggle API key (kaggle.json).Run the dataset download command (as seen in the notebook):Bashkaggle datasets download -d omkargurav/face-mask-dataset
unzip face-mask-dataset.zip -d data
Note: Ensure the dataset is extracted to a folder named data.Execute the Notebook:Open the ML_Project_3_Face_Mask_Detection.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment (like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook) and run all cells sequentially to train the model and test predictions.
